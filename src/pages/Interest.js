            Aside from programming, I enjoy most of my time exercising and playing football, as I am an excellent player, especially in defense.

              When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
              movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a
              large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
              advancements in the front-end web development world.
